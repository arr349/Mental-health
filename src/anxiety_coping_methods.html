                        Question your thoughts - Negative thoughts or thought 
                        distortions are common in people suffering from anxiety.

                        Take one breath for 4 counts. Hold your breath. 
                        Then breathe out for 4 counts.

                        Write down your thoughts - Writing down how you feel in a
                        journal is a good way to let loose and get out of your head.

                    <li>
                        Focus on what you can control - There are somethings in life
                        that you simply can't control. Whether it be an unexpected circumstance or
                        something that someone said. Accept that you can ultimately only control yourself.

                        Grounding - Focus on one inanimate immovable object, such as a wall, clock, or photo.
                        Concentrate only on that object for 10 seconds. Then do it again but for 9 seconds.
                        Then again for 8 seconds, then 7 seconds, until you reach 1 second. There are a lot more

                    <li>
                        Think positive - In our world of constant stress and external pressures, it can be easy
                        to dwell on past failures or regret on what could have happened. Instead of having a
                        pessimistic view on life, try to think about the bright side! Instead of a challenge,
                        think of an oppurtunity.
