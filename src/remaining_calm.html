                    Everyone faces pressure from time to time. In those moments of intense pressure, it's
                    important not to succumb under pressure but rather to rise above it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've accumulated some tips to help you the next time you face pressure.

                <ul>
                    <li>Try Deep Breathing! - Take 5 deep breaths, in and out.</li>
                    <li>
                        Visualization - Imagine the stress flowing out of your body, and relaxation flowing in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control - Focus on what you can control. You can't control outside forces, but you can 
                        control yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perspective - It's important to put things in perspective. Will this matter in 10 years?
                        Will it matter in 20? How about 30? Try to see where things fit in the grand scheme of 
                        things.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Labeling - Try labeling your emotions! Instead of using generic terms like angry or sad,
                        try to be more positive. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nervous => Excited</li>
                            <li>Worried => Concerned</li>
                            <li>Angry => Energetic (in a different way)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
