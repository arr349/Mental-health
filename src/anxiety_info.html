            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> 
                    The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines anxiety as "an emotion
                    characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physical
                    changes." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's completely natural to feel anxiety from time to time, we all get
                    anxious at some point! However, when anxiety starts interfering with
                    other parts of your life, such as work, school, or relationships, that's
                    when it becomes a problem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For someone with an anxiety disorder, anxiety is a debilitating part 
                    of everyday life. As the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) puts it:
                    "the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time".
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with anxiety disorders may have thought distortions or
                    intrusive thoughts of constant worry. The APA says: "They may also avoid certain situations
                    out of worry." Physical symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating,
                    shaking, or dizziness are common.
